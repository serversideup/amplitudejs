# Overview
<carbon-ads/>
The concept of Amplitude.js is simple, allow designers to fully control the look
and feel of their audio player through the web without having to understand
advanced scripting. In HTML5, the audio tag allows users to add common audio
formats to their web page. The problem is that the audio playback interface is
controlled by the browser. Amplitude.js puts you in control of the design by
simply applying a class and/or attributes to page elements. You can then style these
elements through CSS and control your audio. Amplitude.js goes above and
beyond by adding playlist capabilities (next, previous, shuffle), song meta
data and visualizations. Amplitude.js is now mobile friendly as well. If it
detects a request coming from a mobile device it will apply a touchstart event
listener instead of a click to the appropriate elements.
